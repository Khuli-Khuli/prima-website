        About PRIMA
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        PRIMA exists to secure Africa’s infrastructure for the long term.
        It does not chase short-term projects, trends, or political cycles.
        Instead, PRIMA is structured as a permanent infrastructure institution
        — designed to outlast markets, leadership, and generations.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Where critical infrastructure does not exist, PRIMA builds it.
        Where capable systems exist but lack scale, continuity, or governance,
        PRIMA acquires, strengthens, and institutionalizes them.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
        Every decision PRIMA makes is guided by a single principle:
        Africa’s infrastructure must be locally owned, resilient,
        and capable of sustaining societies for generations.
      </p>
