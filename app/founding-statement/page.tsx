        <p>
          PRIMA is founded as a long-term African infrastructure institution.
          Its purpose is to design, build, acquire, and safeguard the
          foundational systems upon which societies depend.
        </p>

        <p>
          PRIMA operates on the principle that durable development is produced
          by coordinated institutions rather than isolated projects. Where
          infrastructure does not exist, PRIMA builds. Where capable systems
          exist but lack continuity, scale, or governance, PRIMA institutionalizes
          them.
        </p>

        <p>
          PRIMA prioritizes long-term ownership, operational resilience, and
          local control. Its mandate is continuity, reliability, and institutional
          memory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through disciplined execution and principled governance, PRIMA seeks
          to strengthen Africa’s capacity to sustain its own infrastructure
          over generations.
