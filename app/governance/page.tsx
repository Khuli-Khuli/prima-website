          PRIMA is structured as an independent, mission-driven institution.
          Its mandate is to safeguard long-term infrastructure interests
          beyond electoral cycles, private capital timelines, or short-term
          policy incentives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Governance is designed to ensure operational autonomy, transparency,
          and accountability across all projects and partnerships.
          Decision-making authority is separated from political office,
          commercial influence, and individual leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
          PRIMA operates under a framework that prioritizes:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Long-term national and regional interest</li>
          <li>Infrastructure sovereignty and public stewardship</li>
          <li>Capital discipline and lifecycle accountability</li>
          <li>Institutional continuity across generations</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This structure enables PRIMA to act as a stable counterparty
          to governments, private investors, and international partners
          while remaining anchored to public purpose.
