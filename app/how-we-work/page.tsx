          PRIMA evaluates every project through a multi-decade lens.
          If an initiative cannot remain viable, governable, and useful
          for generations, it is not pursued — regardless of short-term returns.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          PRIMA structures infrastructure to be institutionally owned,
          locally anchored, and legally protected from political volatility.
          The objective is permanence, not dependence.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          PRIMA does not scale rapidly for its own sake.
          Growth is deliberate, controlled, and aligned with
          operational capacity, governance strength, and societal impact.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Infrastructure is treated as a system, not a standalone asset.
          Energy, transport, data, governance, and human capital
          are evaluated as interconnected layers.
